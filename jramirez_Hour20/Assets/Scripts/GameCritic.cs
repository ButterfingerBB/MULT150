1. Is the game too easy or hard? Give 2 unique reasons why it is easy or hard.
I feel like it's quite difficult to get a good score on this game mostly because of two things: 
a point of view that doesn't cover the farthest edges of the map, and the fact that powerups barely do anything. To be
fair, obstacles aren't much of a detriment either. 

2. What 2 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?

3. List 2 things that would give it a "wow" factor.

4. What 2 parts of the game are fun?

5. What 2 parts of the game are tedious?
