/* 
Changes made to particles:
1. Shape, radius and speed were modified (Cone shaped spread, 50% bigger radius, 2 times as fast).
2. Particles actually slow down over time, with a speed multiplier of 0.8.
3. Changed particle color to blue.
4. Particles now have a lot more collision power, somewhat similar to a tornado.
5. Angular velocity set to 135 degrees, allowing the sphere to float above the particles for a bit longer.
