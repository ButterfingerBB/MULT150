- Is this game too easy or hard?
It's too easy by default, on the basis that it is impossible for the player to lose the game. 
However, trying to beat the game quickly is where the difficulty comes in. Some chaos balls are too small to actually hit.
- What would make it easier or harder?
I would've liked to add a timer that automatically ends the game in a loss if the player takes too long, had I known how to code it.
Extra time pressure could've made things a bit more interesting in a fun way.
If I wanted to make the game a bit easier for whatever reason, bigger bumpers could definitely do the trick.
- What would give it a "wow" factor?
Not sure why, but I thought it would be cool if the bumpers could occasionally shoot somewhat large projectiles that could collide with other balls.
They would help sink those balls into their respective goals, preventing the player from being softlocked by a fast, but very small chaos ball.
- What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious?
I loved watching the balls just bounce all over the place at Mach 1 speed even without my imput!
Things got a bit more silly once I stepped in, because of how the balls interacted with my dual bumpers.
The only part of the game I don't like is when the player is reduced to just 1 or 2 balls, yet they can't seem to hit anything.
This could either be due to the very high speed of the balls, their small size, or the small bumpers.

Suggestions Used:
1. Extra variations of chaos balls (different sizes and locations)
2. Chaos goal implimentation (closes once ALL of the chaos balls are inside of it)
3. Bumper with modified size and shape (player is now dual wielding bumpers, but both are smaller than usual)
4. Changed footsteps audio (sounds more like the player is walking near the sea instead)
